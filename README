I completed all parts of this assignment, collaborating with Nick Souza
on the final step. To compile, run buildos.sh. Running the OS in the simulator
will prompt the user to enter a command. Enterring text will echo it back 
(backspace does function as well). After the readSector message gets printed,
interrupt 21 is called, allowing the user to use readLine (there won't be a 
propmt there). That is then also echoed by interrupt 21.
